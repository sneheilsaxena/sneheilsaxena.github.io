                        A prime number is a number that has exactly 2 factors, the number itself and 1. Prime numbers are an integral part of Mathematics – a large part of number theory and abstract algebra are focused on developing techniques for discovering new prime numbers.
                        They are useful in a variety of ways in today’s digital age – for example, modern computer cryptography works by using prime factors of large numbers. The large number that was used to encrypt a file can be publicly known and available
                        because finding out its prime factors, while technically possible, can take so much time that in practice it’s basically impractical. A modern super-computer could work on a 2048-<a href=“ https://techterms.com/definition/bit”>bit</a>                        factorization problem for longer than the current age of the universe, and still not get the answer.

                        Thus, scientists are constantly working on trying to find out faster ways to figure out if a number is prime. Why would this be an issue in the first place? Well, the naïve algorithm to find out if n is prime looks like this:

                        Essentially, we check if any number between 1 and n divides n by seeing if the remainder is 0 or not (since it would be 0 if the number does divide n). This doesn’t seem too bad for smaller numbers but the bigger the number gets the longer it’ll take.
                        For a 3 digit number? Basically instant. For a 5 digit number? Maybe a couple of minutes. For a 100 digit number? You’re looking at an hour or more possibly, depending on the processing capabilities of the computer. The “time complexity”
                        of this algorithm is n! which in terms of complexity theory is essentially the slowest possible speed for an algorithm.
