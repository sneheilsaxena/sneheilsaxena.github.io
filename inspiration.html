                    <p class="article_text">Life has been particularly transformative over the past few years, and I'd like to take a moment to talk about some of the most influential experiences that have led me to be the person that I am today. These stories serve to of course
                        help you know me better, but more importantly, flesh out why I have the goals I do and how I plan to achieve them.</p>

                    <p class="article_text"> As I’ve grown older and obtained more life experience, one of the lessons I always try to remember is to <b>commit 100%</b> with any activity I engage in. That includes not just putting as much effort as possible from my side but also absorbing
                        as much as possible from whatever I’m getting back. This philosophy has naturally been quite rewarding and while the principle seems obvious in retrospect, that wasn’t always the case; I only had this realization upon making my
                        foray into playing music, and that’s I want to spend some time talking about here.</p>

                    <p class="article_text"> Music – both playing it and writing it have been quite life changing in many regards. I was a weird contradiction of sorts growing up – socially shy, yet most interested in “performance arts” like drama and singing. Because
                        of my inhibitions, I wasn’t able to explore and develop these interests further. For my 16th birthday, I was gifted a guitar by my parents. My favorite artist at that time was Elliott Smith whose songs had very intricate fingerpicking.
                        And therefore began my journey of trying to learn complex parts as a relative beginner.</p>

                    <p class="article_text">Long story short, learning how to play guitar taught me not just the value of perseverance, but
                        what it actually takes to persevere - the beginning was incredibly frustrating, I then made some progress, I hit hurdles,
                        practiced more, anddddd eventually accomplished what I wanted to (learnt the complex fingerpicking part). With this, I
                    actually want to highlight the generality of this above procedure - that's basically how you accomplish any task, and
            I       believe that before music I hadn't experienced being passionate in this manner.</p>

                    <p class="article_text">
                        My absolute favorite artists are Elliott Smith and The Beatles. Check them out!
                    </p>

                    <p class="article_text">
                        The second principle I want to mention is being <b>considerate and empathetic</b> to others. Going through the motions of life,
                        I've realized that just being nice to others is quite fulfilling.
