                    <p style="font-size: xx-large;">As I’ve grown older and obtained more life experience, one of the lessons I always try to remember is to commit 100% with any activity I engage in. That includes not just putting as much effort as possible from my side but also absorbing
                        as much as possible from whatever I’m getting back. This philosophy has naturally been quite rewarding and while the principle seems obvious in retrospect, that wasn’t always the case; I only had this realization upon making my
                        foray into playing music, and that’s I want to spend some time talking about here. Music – both playing it and writing it have been quite life changing in many regards. I was a weird contradiction of sorts growing up – socially
                        shy, yet most interested in “performance arts” like drama and singing. Because of my inhibitions, I wasn’t able to explore and develop these interests further. For my 16th birthday, I was gifted a guitar by my parents. My favorite
                        artist at that time Music is one of my closest passions and my absolute favorite artists are Elliott Smith and The Beatles.
