                    <p class="article_text">
                        I've used React in a variety of settings, both personal and professional, and therefore I've naturally watched a lot of tutorials and explanation videos about it. Towards the beginning of my journey with it, I came across this video:
                    </p>

                    <p class="article_text">
                        As a beginner at not just using React but just client side web development in general, the video made me feel very excited to use React for projects! Now that I have more experience with it however, I want to go back and watch the video to see how my
                        opinions about how it presents things has changed.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article_text">
                        The video starts with a description of React - what it is, where it came from, what it does, and most importantly, what it doesn't do, which I really appreciate. It's all the more important to know the limitations of any new tool you're trying to pick
                        up as a beginner, and I appreciate that Chris takes that into account. He mentions that it’s primarily a client-side JavaScript library made by developers at Facebook and that using it for server-side functionality is uncommon,
                        though technically possible.

                    </p>
                    <p class="article_text">

                        Chris makes an argument for why the library will be adopted even more as time goes on due to changes in its licensing no longer requiring developers to stop using it in case they’re in a lawsuit with Facebook. So far, the arguments are presented well
                        – some time has passed since the video was uploaded and looking at the data, we can indeed see that React usage has gone up exponentially.
                        <br> <br><img src="images/react_stats.jpg"></img><br> In fact, I have observed this anecdotally too from interviewing with different companies and noticing how many of them either already use React or are transitioning to it. Chris
                        says that Angular’s “bi-directional” flow is harder to understand and implement compared to React’s, and in my opinion that is a bit of an apples-oranges comparison. As Mosh writes <a class="article_text" href src=“ https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-vs-angular/”>here</a>,
                        Angular is a full fledged framework for web development with stronger opinions about how the application should be structures as opposed to React, which in the majority of cases is just focused on designing what the user sees.
                        Coupled with his mention of MVC architecture in the intro, I would have liked to see this point being made here as it provides more clarity for beginners, who I presume are the primary audience for this video. Slight cherrypicking,
                        but one of the comments on the video even asks if they need to learn HTML and CSS before using React, which in layman’s terms is like asking to do acrobatics before learning how to walk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_text">

                        I do find the description of how React works and how it’s a “decorative” framework accurate based on my and my past coworkers’ experience. Once again however, during the comparison with Vue and Angular I would have appreciated the framing of the narrative
                        to not just be “React is better and easier to use than Angular for front-end development” but be presented as “React is only focused on front-end, and therefore for those looking to do just front-end React is a better choice than
                        trying to use Angular which is more complex since it does more”.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article_text">
                        Chris then talks about reusable web-components and how that’s the “future of web development” which I do agree with – code reusability has always been a priority in software development in any industry as it increases productivity over time and prevents
                        developers from doing work that has already been done.


                    </p>
                    <p class="article_text">
                        However, vanilla web development technologies also have web components now which can be implemented via: </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol class="article_text">
                            <li> Custom elements </li>
                            <li> Usage of the shadow DOM </li>
                            <li> Usage of the standard HTML template tag </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p class="article_text">
                        The crucial point to remember here is that as we move into the future React might become obsolete as do most new libraries and frameworks, and then all of the web-components written with React in .jsx would no longer be very helpful. In this case, web
                        components built with the aforementioned vanilla technologies like HTML, CSS and JS will be far more likely to continue to be reusable. For those who don’t know - React .jsx code is essentially “compiled” into HTML, CSS and JS
                        code that can be interpreted by the browser. So essentially, React just provides us with an “easier way” to perform complicated actions. All of the “reusable” .jsx code is only reusable so far as React is still used to build the
                        app.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article_text">
                        Chris mentions how React has a relatively small API which I do agree with. If someone already knows the basics, getting started with a React app is definitely (relatively) fast, and its way of maintaining the “state” of a component feels very intuitive
                        once you get into it. Again, for those who don’t know – a React component is basically the same as what you think of as a component in real life. The navigation bar at the top of the page? Probably a component. The “Buy now” button
                        on Amazon? Again, probably a component. The idea of “state” is that depending on the context, the same component could be displaying different things to the viewer and thus behaving differently. What React does is it formalizes
                        the idea of a component having a state so it’s “easier” to get the component to behave differently under different circumstances as opposed to plain HTML, CSS and JS where you would have to do some of the heavy lifting manually.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article_text">
                        I don’t particularly have an opinion on JSX either way like Chris does – I believe that every tool has its own set of rules for using it and I think you should try to accept guidelines that are so integral to the how the tool is supposed to be used. The
                        separation of concerns between HTML and JS usually makes sense – it’s easier to handle different things differently. But since React mixes those together as a design principle, it’s more useful to just adopt that method than trying
                        to go against the grain. Either that, or considering not using React! At the end of the day, React’s only real advantage over vanilla languages is that it improves the developer experience. If you’re disliking using React, you’re
                        negating the only real advantage it provides you and so you’re better off just switching to something else.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_text">
                        Using React for mobile and VR apps in my view is only really useful if React is already your tool of choice for web development and you want to transition into a new area. If you’re starting from scratch, you’re better off learning the most widely used
                        languages & frameworks such as Swift for iOS and Kotlin/Java for Android. Chris doesn’t say anything contrary to this but I believe this point deserves being mentioned.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_text">
                        React’s community is indeed quite large now and support is not too tough to find. I would say though that that goes for most programming languages, libraries and frameworks that are popular and if this arguments is being made to show that “React is better
                        than other frameworks/libraries” then it’s not the best reason.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article_text">
                        Chris’ points about React developers earning a lot of money might be a valid reason for someone to want to learn it if they want a better paying job but if we’re talking purely about the technical merits of the language it’s not really a good argument.
                        Similarly, his argument about a lot of big companies using it is also not a great argument for the technical merits of the language. Popularity != quality. But looking back to the title of the video and the supposed audience –
                        I believe it was appropriate to mention it here since he didn’t spend a lot of time talking about these factors.

                    </p>
                    <p class="article_text">
                        Overall, the video made a good case for using React. Through the experience I now have and data for websites’ loading times I’ve seen, in my opinion React is actually slower for the user and it makes them use up more data. There is a tradeoff between
                        the developer experience and the user experience, and I would have liked to see more of that nuance covered in this video. However, there still were a lot of good points and looking back at this video was definitely a worthwhile
                        experience!
